"""The packaged SKILL.md ↔ workflow.py contract — a cheap mechanical net under the rulebook.

SKILL.md is the agent RULEBOOK, not documentation. Since #88 the server refreshes every
consumer's installed copy on start (sync_installed_artifacts), so it auto-propagates over the
moving `stable` branch with NO per-consumer pin, NO test, and NO review gate of its own. That
inverts the old silent-drift risk (#116): a rule naming a stage / label / marker / next_task
signal the tools no longer have would now reach every agent, everywhere, with nothing to catch
it. These tests pin the MECHANICAL subset of the contract — every code token the rulebook cites
must still resolve in workflow.py, and every real stage must be documented. They deliberately do
NOT check semantic correctness (whether a rule is right) — that is what independent review,
widened to every change in #117, is for; this is only the net that catches a cited token going
stale on either side.
